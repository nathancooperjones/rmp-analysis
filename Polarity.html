<h1>1: <em><span style="color: green">+.606</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Pro.</mark> <mark class = "pos">lee absolutely did a great job at lecturing CS450, he did review all the basics before you get started to work on the OS, the only down side is that he did not spent enough time to lecture file systems instead spending too much time on concurrency.</mark></p>
<h1>2: <em><span style="color: green">+.315</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Awesome lecturer.</mark> He teaches by doing so any question you have and he'll show you why intuitively by walking through the code. <mark class = "pos">His excitement in class makes you want to listen, participate and learn.</mark></p>
<h1>3: <em><span style="color: green">+.168</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">His teaching style makes you enjoy the class.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Worth starting labs earlier, since they are not typical easy programming assignments.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Hell make sure everyone understands the topic.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Do the labs, since they worth 50 points.</mark></p>
<h1>4: <em><span style="color: green">+.307</span></em></h1><p class="indented">This class is absolutely coding heavy, there are 4 heavy lab assignments which contains at least 300 - 1000 lines of codes each. <mark class = "pos">If you are familiar with C languages, especially the usage of pointers, you have no problem to ace this class.</mark> There are only several concepts you have to implement with the C lang. <mark class = "pos">Good luck!</mark></p>
<h1>5: <em><span style="color: green">+.084</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">He is a great teacher but his tests and labs are hard.</mark> <mark class = "pos">You gotta devote time to his classes, they aren't easy A/Bs.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Upsides: Reallllyyyy easy on the eyes, cares about whether his students learn or not</mark></p>
<h1>6: <em><span style="color: green">+.805</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Saelee is by far the best teacher/professor I have ever had.</mark> <mark class = "pos">He's obviously extremely passionate about computer science and is the most knowledgeable professor I've ever had.</mark> <mark class = "pos">He is the most confident speaker/presenter I've seen as well which makes students very attentive/excited to learn in class.</mark></p>
<h1>7: <em><span style="color: green">+.348</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">SUUUUUUPER energetic, his structured in a way that its actually fun to attend.</mark> <mark class = "pos">He himself is a good teacher.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Only complaint is that he expects ppl to have a certain background knowledge even for an introductory course.</mark></p>
<h1>8: <em><span style="color: green">+.392</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Really good at lecturing and taking the time to make sure students understand the topic.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Always eager to help students outside of class as well.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Really funny, too.</mark> There were only labs, a midterm, and a final for grades. Labs were 50%, midterm 25%, and final 25%. <mark class = "pos">The labs were tough, so get an early start on those.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Have fun!</mark></p>
<h1>9: <em><span style="color: green">+.396</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Great professor.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Lectures are very involved and aren't boring in general.</mark> Labs are basically self graded so you know what grade you're going to get before you turn it in. <mark class = "pos">Seems to care about students and is always willing to take questions.</mark> <mark class = "pos">In general the professor is very nice and the class was great, would recommend.</mark></p>
<h1>10: <em><span style="color: green">+.159</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">He is very patient to his students, even if  you ask about very conceptual or primary code design on his class or on office hours(I always do), he will give you a very good insight to the problem instead of rephrasing the problem statement.</mark> <mark class = "pos">In a word, nice-guy.</mark></p>
<h1>11: <em><span style="color: green">+.580</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">The intro to the profession CS is basically not graded if you take Lee, he exposes you to a bunch of different material and projects from different areas of CS but the pressure of doing well is nonexistent.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Super fun, personable teacher.</mark></p>
<h1>12: <em><span style="color: green">+.209</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Clearly passionate about CS as a subject and wants students to understand.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Pay attention to his lectures and you really will learn a lot.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Beware, exams are multiple choice.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Main frustration came from very slow grading time -- he graded 90% of our labs only a couple of days before the final.</mark></p>
<h1>13: <em><span style="color: green">+.228</span></em></h1><p class="indented">If you do the labs & quizzes, all you need is a 70-75 on the final and you've earned yourself an A. <mark class = "pos">Moreover, every exam replaces the grade of the previous exams (granted that it's received a higher grade).</mark> <mark class = "pos">Pay attention in this class, it's very important for all CS/CE majors.</mark></p>
<h1>14: <em><span style="color: green">+.310</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Lectures are great.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Labs are checked using unit testing, so you're pretty much guaranteed full credit as long as you can make your code pass.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Tests are multiple choice and aren't too hard as long as you understand what was taught in class.</mark></p>
<h1>15: <em><span style="color: red">-.223</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">Isn't clear whatsoever about grades, assignments, lectures and much more.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Overall, bad teacher.</mark></p>
<h1>16: <em><span style="color: green">+.425</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Amazing lecturer, well-spoken kind person.</mark> <mark class = "pos">He recognizes that the material is difficult and explains things very clearly.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The class is interactive and he is responsive to what the needs of the class are (ie extensions).</mark> <mark class = "pos">He also posts helpful videos that are hugely beneficial to completing machine problems which contain helpful hints in themselves.</mark></p>
<h1>17: <em><span style="color: green">+.297</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">HE IS HOT.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Also a good teacher.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Easy A. Just attendance matters.</mark></p>
<h1>18: <em><span style="color: green">+.587</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">CS100 Fall 2015 - the best of the best.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Very clear and coolest professor you'll ever meet.</mark></p>
<h1>19: <em><span style="color: green">+.270</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Dude is a great instructor.</mark> <mark class = "pos">He is really chill and loves joking around with you.</mark> <mark class = "pos">You will learn a lot while enjoying the class.</mark> It is really interactive too. <mark class = "neg">Also he drives a sick motorcycle.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I asked him if he was inspirational and he said no.</mark></p>
<h1>20: <em><span style="color: green">+.251</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">He's a great lecturer.</mark> <mark class = "pos">He's very funny and easy to listen to.</mark> <mark class = "pos">He keeps things interesting but his lessons also feel very linear and intuitive.</mark> Whatever textbook he tells you to get, do it. <mark class = "pos">You won't have homework from it but the info is vital.</mark> <mark class = "pos">He's way nice.</mark> <mark class = "neg">And way better than I would be at tolerating stupid questions that were JUST answered.</mark></p>
<h1>21: <em><span style="color: red">-.092</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Reingold was funny, I admit.</mark> <mark class = "neg">However, he does tend to cross the line when his comments begin to sound more rude and insulting than anything.</mark> <mark class = "pos">He really understands the material at hand but is unable to answer simple questions that we find confusing.</mark> <mark class = "neg">If it is too trivial for him, he dismisses you.</mark> <mark class = "neg">And if he does answer, he makes sure to insult you.</mark></p>
<h1>22: <em><span style="color: red">-.079</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">PROS: He's a nice guy, he's funny, he posts lecture notes online, and questions from those lecture notes may show up on exams.</mark> <mark class = "neg">CONS: His exams are INSANE!!!</mark> They do not reflect his homework assignments. One of our exams had a class average of around 40%!!! <mark class = "neg">OVERALL: You'll learn a lot, but avoid him if you value your GPA.</mark></p>
<h1>23: <em><span style="color: green">+.998</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">He is one of the best IIT professor, clear and well-prepared lectures, clean logic, follow him you did learn more than you imagine!</mark></p>
<h1>24: <em><span style="color: red">-.068</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">To be honest, he is an intellectual and nice professor that he is trying to explain every questions students asked about, but many times those questions are quite trivial to give the answer back that you can see many previous posts blamed him for.</mark> <mark class = "neg">But his grading policy is very strict, such as 25% of the people got A and rest of them got others.</mark></p>
<h1>25: <em><span style="color: red">-.231</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">To be honest once you learn how he structures his exams and print out the notes and previous exams to take in with you the exams are not impossible.</mark> <mark class = "neg">HOWEVER he is extremely rude to students, especially if you raise your hand and get something wrong that he thinks is "utterly trivial".</mark></p>
<h1>26: <em><span style="color: green">+.030</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Reingold is a great professor, but don't mistake this as a metric for how easy the class is.</mark> <mark class = "pos">He knows what he's talking about and is able to explain it well (most of the time).</mark> <mark class = "neg">However, his weekly homework assignments take a lot of time and his tests are hard.</mark> <mark class = "neg">If you take this class with him you'll learn a lot, but it'll be a miserable time.</mark></p>
<h1>27: <em><span style="color: green">+.017</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Reingold's class has given me the single most hostile learning environment I have ever been a part of.</mark> <mark class = "neg">This class requires a ridiculous amount of effort -- the homework assignments can take several days to complete, a higher workload than all of my other classes combined.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Makes fun of students in class and is incredibly condescending.</mark> Do NOT take!!</p>
<h1>28: <em><span style="color: red">-.102</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">He teaches like we are Masters students, those who get the subject, get it;those who dont get it stay like that for the rest of the semester.</mark> <mark class = "neg">He is not approachable, is mean and insensitive.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Dont really know what to expect in terms of exam questions.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Read the book, refer to material on the internet and teach yourself.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Exams very hard but curved</mark></p>
<h1>29: <em><span style="color: green">+.100</span></em></h1><p class="indented">He wants you to know everything before hand. <mark class = "pos">You should be an expert to take his class.</mark></p>
<h1>30: <em><span style="color: green">+.000</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Teaches in class from "Introduction to Algorithms" , HW  from "Algorithm design" and exams  "Art of c programming".</mark> <mark class = "neg">Nothing fancy nor great!</mark> <mark class = "neg">You cannot learn much if you are not good in algorithm before.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Here, to learn intro to algorithm you have to be expert in algorithm first!</mark> <mark class = "pos">Every week course become tougher and you will be succumbed at last!</mark></p>
<h1>31: <em><span style="color: red">-.054</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">He got confused sometimes in the lecture.</mark> <mark class = "pos">There're only homework (no exams), and this class required a lot of reading.</mark> It usually took more than 1 day to finish one  homework.</p>
<h1>32: <em><span style="color: red">-.065</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">Reallyhave to put in too much effort, Masters students dont have that much of a luxury, it may be easy if it was during a phd.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Tough exam questions.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Hard to score.</mark> Relative grading.</p>
<h1>33: <em><span style="color: green">+.327</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">He tries to make topic more and more interesting for the students.</mark> If you do not love algorithms, think twice before taking any of his advanced classes. <mark class = "pos">Teaching style is very elegant, and you won't get bored even in a 3 hours lecture.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Experience does matter a lot, and he proves it every time.</mark></p>
<h1>34: <em><span style="color: green">+.397</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Prof. Reingold is really smart and he gave us pretty tough exams.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Trust me, the average is about 35 out of 100 but you can get an A if you reach 60.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The materials are hard but the grades are pretty good.</mark> <mark class = "pos">He curves the final grades so you can get an A if you are the top 30%.</mark> Don't miss the chance to enjoy his classes.</p>
<h1>35: <em><span style="color: green">+.044</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Professor Reingold is incredibly smart and his material is tough!</mark> <mark class = "neg">I love him for the fantastic methodslogic he taught us, but it was not easy bringing my grade from an F to an A!</mark> <mark class = "neg">He is the first teacher I have felt I could *not* ask for help on the subject, so my suggestion to you is to get used to teaching yourself on a whiteboard!</mark></p>
<h1>36: <em><span style="color: green">+.546</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Clear explanation of concepts, funny, nice and helpful prof. Gave me great advice about grad school - thanks!</mark> <mark class = "pos">Makes class fun with jokes and little bugs for extra credit if you catch him out.</mark></p>
<h1>37: <em><span style="color: green">+.193</span></em></h1><p class="indented">E. <mark class = "pos">Reingold is very good professor.</mark> <mark class = "pos">You need to study the text book a lot if you are taking his class.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The thing I liked him is he takes 3 exams.</mark> So we don't have to remember the whole syllabus in the final exam. Grades are curved.</p>
<h1>38: <em><span style="color: red">-.200</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">Avoid this professor, if possible.</mark> <mark class = "pos">He's not great at explaining concepts or answering questions; he assumes that you understand what to him are basic concepts.</mark> <mark class = "pos">If you have to take his class, read the book a lot, and use the tutoring center.</mark> <mark class = "neg">It's possible to pass, but this won't be your favorite class unless the topic is already your fav.</mark></p>
<h1>39: <em><span style="color: green">+.268</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">He is a nice prof. Knew what he was talking about and was fair with the grading.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I totally recommend this class to everyone who do not have a lot of knowledge about theory and algos..</mark> <mark class = "pos">He is cool</mark></p>
<h1>40: <em><span style="color: green">+.105</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Different than most IIT profs -- more similar to large university lecturing prof. Presents the lecture material every class and the rest is up to the TA.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Extremely tough prof, even by other profs' standards.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Grades are curved - highest grade sets the limit.</mark> <mark class = "pos">He is a nice guy though and will help you if you need.</mark></p>
<h1>41: <em><span style="color: green">+.390</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Although I liked him, I don't think I could have kept up with the class if it wasn't for my fantastic AP Calculus teacher in high school.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Again, he is a great guy, but if you actually want to learn the material, you will need to teach yourself.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Also, he doesn't enter grades till the very end which is kind of stressful but he hands back graded work.</mark></p>
<h1>42: <em><span style="color: green">+.265</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Good guy.</mark> 10/10</p>
<h1>43: <em><span style="color: green">+.051</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">Easiest grade ever, but I didn't learn ANYTHING.</mark> Dif. eq. <mark class = "pos">is the most important mathematics course for engineers and now I'm having to re-learn everything in upper level MMAE courses.</mark></p>
<h1>44: <em><span style="color: green">+.465</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Very nice professor.</mark> <mark class = "pos">He is an extremely lenient grader and on top of that the quizzes and exams are just problems he goes over in class.</mark> <mark class = "pos">He has one webassign due every week but extends the due date at the end of the semester so you can make up most of it.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Only have to do 50% of homework to get the full homework credit, the rest is extra credit.</mark></p>
<h1>45: <em><span style="color: green">+.226</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Easy grader, ok teacher.</mark> <mark class = "neg">If you have taken Calc before, and don't want to do that much work, he's your guy.</mark> <mark class = "neg">However if you have never taken calc or are not that confident in your skills, I'd go with another teacher bc Miranda is bad at answering questions and kind of gives up on them.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Otherwise, its a pretty fun class.</mark></p>
<h1>46: <em><span style="color: green">+.358</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Easiest grader I've ever had</mark></p>
<h1>47: <em><span style="color: green">+.398</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">He explains very clearly, he is very helpful.</mark> If you miss class he is understanding so long as you know what he is teaching. <mark class = "pos">He sincerely wants us to learn he can also be humorous at times.</mark> <mark class = "neg">If somethings not clear he would go over it many times.</mark> <mark class = "pos">QUALITY LECTURES!!!</mark></p>
<h1>48: <em><span style="color: green">+.591</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Miranda is a very nice guy, he is willing to help you and is always very cheerful and positive.</mark> <mark class = "pos">You wont learn much from his lectures, you have to teach yourself the content if you truly want to learn.</mark> <mark class = "pos">This class is an easy A, if you're looking for that hes your guy.</mark> <mark class = "pos">If you really need to learn the content of the course id go with someone else.</mark></p>
<h1>49: <em><span style="color: green">+.156</span></em></h1><p class="indented">I took Miranda for both Calc 2 and Diff Eq. <mark class = "pos">Not the most amazing of lecturers, but he makes up for it with being an easy grader.</mark> <mark class = "neg">He pulls quiz questions from problems he went over in lecture, and then all of his exam questions are from those quizes (numbers may or may not be changed).</mark> <mark class = "pos">Lots of easy points and extra credit in his class.</mark> TAKE HIM!!</p>
<h1>50: <em><span style="color: green">+.214</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Miranda is awesome.</mark> <mark class = "pos">During lectures, make sure to write down EVERYTHING he does, and you'll do fine.</mark> Quizzes every Friday and you're allowed an index card of notes. <mark class = "pos">He's a lenient grader and gives partial credit for everything.</mark> Tests aren't cumulative. <mark class = "pos">Attendance taken for every class, but he makes himself available outside of class too</mark></p>
<h1>51: <em><span style="color: green">+.538</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">He really is not a good teacher, but he is a super easy grader, always giving generous partial credit.</mark> I have a B in DiffEq and I have no idea what I'm doing.</p>
<h1>52: <em><span style="color: green">+.375</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">His lecture notes are very comprehensive and if you write down exactly what he does and study from it, you'll get an A because his quizzes are the same as is example problems.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The webassign will be enough to study for the tests, just go to class and take notes, he's the easiest most generous grader at IIT.</mark></p>
<h1>53: <em><span style="color: green">+.234</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Miranda is a great teacher, if you come to class everyday you will understand his material.</mark> There is weekly quizzes and homework assignments, but if you do the homework, the quizzes should on par with the homework. <mark class = "pos">Doing 50% of homework gets you an A in homework, doing the rest would result in extra credit.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Would recommend this teacher to anyone.</mark></p>
<h1>54: <em><span style="color: green">+.062</span></em></h1><p class="indented">If you can take Jesus Miranda for any math course, DO IT. <mark class = "neg">You would have to try with some effort to get anything lower than a B.</mark> In other words, you will probably get an A. <mark class = "pos">The homework is straight off Webassign, and he doesn't make it too difficult.</mark> <mark class = "pos">His grading on tests is VERY lenient.</mark> Take him if you want an A.</p>
<h1>55: <em><span style="color: red">-.002</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">BEST CALC 2 PROF YOU CAN GET AT IIT.</mark> Barley any hw.

<h1>56: <em><span style="color: green">+.185</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Classes are to the point and well explained.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Prof Miranda is an extremely nice person, which in itself makes everything so much easier.</mark> He allows equation sheets in exams. Gives weekly homework. <mark class = "pos">The course was a breeze.</mark> <mark class = "pos">If you read the text and pay attention to lectures, solid understanding is guaranteed.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The Prof also adds humour to the mix.</mark> :)</p>
<h1>57: <em><span style="color: green">+.178</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Great professor.</mark> Roasts kids all the time. <mark class = "pos">Quizzes/exams aren't very difficult if you do the homework.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Exams are questions from quizzes + some questions from sections covered between quiz and exam.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Great course overall.</mark></p>

<h1>61: <em><span style="color: green">+.280</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Best computer science professor ever, hands down.</mark> <mark class = "pos">He is thorough and puts 110% into his classes.</mark> <mark class = "pos">He does assign a lot of work and makes you watch pre-lecture videos, but I learned more than anyone who had the other professors.</mark> 10/10 should take.</p>
<h1>62: <em><span style="color: green">+.566</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">The labs are a big portion of your learning and grade, so hopefully you have a good TA!</mark></p>
