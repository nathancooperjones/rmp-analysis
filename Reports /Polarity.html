<h1>48: <em><span style="color: green">+.606</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Pro.</mark> <mark class = "pos">lee absolutely did a great job at lecturing CS450, he did review all the basics before you get started to work on the OS, the only down side is that he did not spent enough time to lecture file systems instead spending too much time on concurrency.</mark></p>
<h1>49: <em><span style="color: green">+.315</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Awesome lecturer.</mark> He teaches by doing so any question you have and he'll show you why intuitively by walking through the code. <mark class = "pos">His excitement in class makes you want to listen, participate and learn.</mark></p>
<h1>50: <em><span style="color: green">+.168</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">His teaching style makes you enjoy the class.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Worth starting labs earlier, since they are not typical easy programming assignments.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Hell make sure everyone understands the topic.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Do the labs, since they worth 50 points.</mark></p>
<h1>51: <em><span style="color: green">+.307</span></em></h1><p class="indented">This class is absolutely coding heavy, there are 4 heavy lab assignments which contains at least 300 - 1000 lines of codes each. <mark class = "pos">If you are familiar with C languages, especially the usage of pointers, you have no problem to ace this class.</mark> There are only several concepts you have to implement with the C lang. <mark class = "pos">Good luck!</mark></p>
<h1>52: <em><span style="color: green">+.084</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">He is a great teacher but his tests and labs are hard.</mark> <mark class = "pos">You gotta devote time to his classes, they aren't easy A/Bs.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Upsides: Reallllyyyy easy on the eyes, cares about whether his students learn or not</mark></p>
<h1>53: <em><span style="color: green">+.805</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Saelee is by far the best teacher/professor I have ever had.</mark> <mark class = "pos">He's obviously extremely passionate about computer science and is the most knowledgeable professor I've ever had.</mark> <mark class = "pos">He is the most confident speaker/presenter I've seen as well which makes students very attentive/excited to learn in class.</mark></p>
<h1>54: <em><span style="color: green">+.348</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">SUUUUUUPER energetic, his structured in a way that its actually fun to attend.</mark> <mark class = "pos">He himself is a good teacher.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Only complaint is that he expects ppl to have a certain background knowledge even for an introductory course.</mark></p>
<h1>55: <em><span style="color: green">+.392</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Really good at lecturing and taking the time to make sure students understand the topic.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Always eager to help students outside of class as well.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Really funny, too.</mark> There were only labs, a midterm, and a final for grades.

<h1>56: <em><span style="color: green">+.396</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Great professor.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Lectures are very involved and aren't boring in general.</mark> Labs are basically self graded so you know what grade you're going to get before you turn it in. <mark class = "pos">Seems to care about students and is always willing to take questions.</mark> <mark class = "pos">In general the professor is very nice and the class was great, would recommend.</mark></p>
<h1>57: <em><span style="color: green">+.159</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">He is very patient to his students, even if  you ask about very conceptual or primary code design on his class or on office hours(I always do), he will give you a very good insight to the problem instead of rephrasing the problem statement.</mark> <mark class = "pos">In a word, nice-guy.</mark></p>
<h1>58: <em><span style="color: green">+.580</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">The intro to the profession CS is basically not graded if you take Lee, he exposes you to a bunch of different material and projects from different areas of CS but the pressure of doing well is nonexistent.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Super fun, personable teacher.</mark></p>
<h1>59: <em><span style="color: green">+.209</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Clearly passionate about CS as a subject and wants students to understand.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Pay attention to his lectures and you really will learn a lot.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Beware, exams are multiple choice.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Main frustration came from very slow grading time -- he graded 90% of our labs only a couple of days before the final.</mark></p>
<h1>60: <em><span style="color: green">+.228</span></em></h1><p class="indented">If you do the labs & quizzes, all you need is a 70-75 on the final and you've earned yourself an A. <mark class = "pos">Moreover, every exam replaces the grade of the previous exams (granted that it's received a higher grade).</mark> <mark class = "pos">Pay attention in this class, it's very important for all CS/CE majors.</mark></p>
<h1>61: <em><span style="color: green">+.310</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Lectures are great.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Labs are checked using unit testing, so you're pretty much guaranteed full credit as long as you can make your code pass.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Tests are multiple choice and aren't too hard as long as you understand what was taught in class.</mark></p>
<h1>62: <em><span style="color: red">-.223</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">Isn't clear whatsoever about grades, assignments, lectures and much more.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Overall, bad teacher.</mark></p>
<h1>63: <em><span style="color: green">+.425</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Amazing lecturer, well-spoken kind person.</mark> <mark class = "pos">He recognizes that the material is difficult and explains things very clearly.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The class is interactive and he is responsive to what the needs of the class are (ie extensions).</mark> <mark class = "pos">He also posts helpful videos that are hugely beneficial to completing machine problems which contain helpful hints in themselves.</mark></p>
<h1>64: <em><span style="color: green">+.297</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">HE IS HOT.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Also a good teacher.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Easy A. Just attendance matters.</mark></p>
<h1>65: <em><span style="color: green">+.587</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">CS100 Fall 2015 - the best of the best.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Very clear and coolest professor you'll ever meet.</mark></p>

<h1>67: <em><span style="color: green">+.251</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">He's a great lecturer.</mark> <mark class = "pos">He's very funny and easy to listen to.</mark> <mark class = "pos">He keeps things interesting but his lessons also feel very linear and intuitive.</mark> Whatever textbook he tells you to get, do it. <mark class = "pos">You won't have homework from it but the info is vital.</mark> <mark class = "pos">He's way nice.</mark> <mark class = "neg">And way better than I would be at tolerating stupid questions that were JUST answered.</mark></p>
<h1>68: <em><span style="color: green">+.390</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Although I liked him, I don't think I could have kept up with the class if it wasn't for my fantastic AP Calculus teacher in high school.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Again, he is a great guy, but if you actually want to learn the material, you will need to teach yourself.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Also, he doesn't enter grades till the very end which is kind of stressful but he hands back graded work.</mark></p>
<h1>69: <em><span style="color: green">+.265</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Good guy.</mark> 10/10</p>
<h1>70: <em><span style="color: green">+.051</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">Easiest grade ever, but I didn't learn ANYTHING.</mark> Dif. eq. <mark class = "pos">is the most important mathematics course for engineers and now I'm having to re-learn everything in upper level MMAE courses.</mark></p>
<h1>71: <em><span style="color: green">+.465</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Very nice professor.</mark> <mark class = "pos">He is an extremely lenient grader and on top of that the quizzes and exams are just problems he goes over in class.</mark> <mark class = "pos">He has one webassign due every week but extends the due date at the end of the semester so you can make up most of it.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Only have to do 50% of homework to get the full homework credit, the rest is extra credit.</mark></p>
<h1>72: <em><span style="color: green">+.226</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Easy grader, ok teacher.</mark> <mark class = "neg">If you have taken Calc before, and don't want to do that much work, he's your guy.</mark> <mark class = "neg">However if you have never taken calc or are not that confident in your skills, I'd go with another teacher bc Miranda is bad at answering questions and kind of gives up on them.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Otherwise, its a pretty fun class.</mark></p>
<h1>73: <em><span style="color: green">+.358</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Easiest grader I've ever had</mark></p>
<h1>74: <em><span style="color: green">+.398</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">He explains very clearly, he is very helpful.</mark> If you miss class he is understanding so long as you know what he is teaching. <mark class = "pos">He sincerely wants us to learn he can also be humorous at times.</mark> <mark class = "neg">If somethings not clear he would go over it many times.</mark> <mark class = "pos">QUALITY LECTURES!!!</mark></p>
<h1>75: <em><span style="color: green">+.591</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Miranda is a very nice guy, he is willing to help you and is always very cheerful and positive.</mark> <mark class = "pos">You wont learn much from his lectures, you have to teach yourself the content if you truly want to learn.</mark> <mark class = "pos">This class is an easy A, if you're looking for that hes your guy.</mark> <mark class = "pos">If you really need to learn the content of the course id go with someone else.</mark></p>
<h1>76: <em><span style="color: green">+.156</span></em></h1><p class="indented">I took Miranda for both Calc 2 and Diff Eq. <mark class = "pos">Not the most amazing of lecturers, but he makes up for it with being an easy grader.</mark> <mark class = "neg">He pulls quiz questions from problems he went over in lecture, and then all of his exam questions are from those quizes (numbers may or may not be changed).</mark> <mark class = "pos">Lots of easy points and extra credit in his class.</mark> TAKE HIM!!</p>
<h1>77: <em><span style="color: green">+.214</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Miranda is awesome.</mark> <mark class = "pos">During lectures, make sure to write down EVERYTHING he does, and you'll do fine.</mark> Quizzes every Friday and you're allowed an index card of notes. <mark class = "pos">He's a lenient grader and gives partial credit for everything.</mark> Tests aren't cumulative. <mark class = "pos">Attendance taken for every class, but he makes himself available outside of class too</mark></p>
<h1>78: <em><span style="color: green">+.538</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">He really is not a good teacher, but he is a super easy grader, always giving generous partial credit.</mark> I have a B in DiffEq and I have no idea what I'm doing.</p>
<h1>79: <em><span style="color: green">+.375</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">His lecture notes are very comprehensive and if you write down exactly what he does and study from it, you'll get an A because his quizzes are the same as is example problems.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The webassign will be enough to study for the tests, just go to class and take notes, he's the easiest most generous grader at IIT.</mark></p>
<h1>80: <em><span style="color: green">+.234</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Miranda is a great teacher, if you come to class everyday you will understand his material.</mark> There is weekly quizzes and homework assignments, but if you do the homework, the quizzes should on par with the homework. <mark class = "pos">Doing 50% of homework gets you an A in homework, doing the rest would result in extra credit.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Would recommend this teacher to anyone.</mark></p>
<h1>81: <em><span style="color: green">+.062</span></em></h1><p class="indented">If you can take Jesus Miranda for any math course, DO IT. <mark class = "neg">You would have to try with some effort to get anything lower than a B.</mark> In other words, you will probably get an A. <mark class = "pos">The homework is straight off Webassign, and he doesn't make it too difficult.</mark> <mark class = "pos">His grading on tests is VERY lenient.</mark> Take him if you want an A.</p>
